# Incident Response for Web Applications Cheat Sheet

## Introduction

Incident response is a crucial aspect of web application security, ensuring swift and effective actions are taken when security incidents occur. This comprehensive cheat sheet provides technical guidance for handling incidents throughout the entire lifecycle.

## Common Security Issues

### 1. Incident Detection

- Utilize robust logging mechanisms to capture relevant security events. \
  Enable verbose logging: `LogLevel debug`
<!-- textlint-disable terminology -->
- Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) for real-time monitoring. \
  Snort IDS rule example:
<!-- textlint-enable -->
  `alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"Possible SQL injection attempt"; content:"SELECT * FROM"; sid:1000001;)`
- Employ anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns in user behavior. \
  Python script for anomaly detection:
  `from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest`

### 2. Analysis and Triage

- Establish an incident response team (IRT) with roles like Forensic Analyst, Malware Analyst, and Incident Coordinator. \
  Incident Response Team (IRT):
  
    - Forensic Analyst: Conducts digital forensics investigations.
    - Malware Analyst: Analyzes malicious code and artifacts.
    - Incident Coordinator: Coordinates overall incident response efforts.
- Leverage digital forensics tools for in-depth analysis of affected systems. \
  Use Autopsy for disk analysis: `autopsy -i <image_path>`
- Conduct memory analysis to identify malicious processes and artifacts. \
  Volatility framework example:
  `vol.py -f <memory_dump> --profile=<profile> pslist`

### 3. Containment and Eradication

- Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement. \
  Network isolation using iptables: `iptables -A INPUT -s <infected_IP> -j DROP`
- Employ network segmentation to contain the spread of the incident. \
  VLAN configuration example: \
  `switchport mode access` \
  `switchport access vlan <segment_ID>`
- Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for real-time threat containment. \
  Carbon Black sensor commands: `cbresponse -th <threat_hash> -d`
- Eradicate malware and backdoors using antivirus tools and manual inspection. \
  ClamAV scan for malware: `clamscan -r /path/to/scan`

### 4. Recovery

- Develop a recovery plan outlining steps to restore services securely. \
  Recovery Plan:
  
  1. Restore from clean backups.
  2. Validate the integrity of restored data.
  3. Monitor network traffic for signs of re-infection.
- Monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity during the recovery phase. \
  Wireshark filter for suspicious traffic: `tcp.flags == 0x02 && ip.src != trusted_IP`
- Validate data integrity to ensure recovered systems are not compromised. \
  File integrity validation using md5sum: `md5sum -c integrity_checksums`

### 5. Lessons Learned

- Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis (PIA) to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- Update incident response plans based on PIA findings.
- Provide training sessions for the incident response team to enhance skills.

## Incident Response Objectives

### 1. Incident Response Plan

- Develop a detailed incident response plan (IRP) specific to web application security.
- Define communication protocols, including secure channels for incident reporting.
- Establish clear escalation procedures for different types of incidents.

### 2. Communication Strategies

- Establish a communication hierarchy to disseminate incident information efficiently.
- Draft incident notification templates for internal and external stakeholders.
- Implement secure communication channels, considering encrypted email and secure messaging apps.

### 3. Evidence Preservation

- Document incidents thoroughly, preserving logs, screenshots, and memory dumps.
- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements for evidence preservation.
- Implement digital chain-of-custody procedures for all collected evidence.

### 4. Quick Incident Identification and Response

- Implement automated incident detection through security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
- Conduct regular incident response drills to enhance team readiness and response times.
